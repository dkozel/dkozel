# Hello and Welcome!

Iâ€™m a researcher at Cardiff University in the Centre for High Frequency Engineering. My focus is on high efficiency RF power amplifiers for wireless communications.

I'm heavily involved in the [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org) project as a coordinator and contributor. Currently I'm focused on project governance, internships, and community building/maintenance.

My primary active technical interests are around the Free and Open Source Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) toolchains and ecosystem, particularily Yosys, nmigen, and LiteX.

## Electronics

* [RF Noise Source Power Supply](https://github.com/dkozel/noisesource-psu)
* [LTZ1000 based Voltage Reference](https://github.com/dkozel/voltage_reference)

## Software

* [gr-verilog](https://github.com/gnuradio/gr-verilog)
* [gr-dpd](https://github.com/gnuradio/gr-verilog)
* [gr-ata](https://github.com/HCROatATA/gr-ata)
* [gr-latencymanager](https://github.com/dkozel/gr-latencymanager)

## Misc

I'm also learning how to maintain Debian packages, starting with [GNU Archimedes](https://www.gnu.org/software/archimedes/) and [linux-gpib](https://github.com/dkozel/linux-gpib_debian).
